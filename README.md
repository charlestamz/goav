# **ffmpeg golang binding**
# why a new goav fork?
- the google top goav result doesn't work anymore. 
- a recent working fork I tested is [here](https://github.com/asticode/goav)
- make it usable and compatile for FFmpeg 3.x or 4.x under ubuntu 18.04, 20.04

from here:
Golang binding for __FFmpeg 4.1.1__.   Forked from [here](https://github.com/amarburg/goav)
